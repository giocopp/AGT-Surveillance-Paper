## Abstract
This paper models algorithmic surveillance as a strategic game of incomplete information, using Israel's Blue Wolf biometric identification program in Hebron as a case study. Building on the preventive repression framework of \citet{dragu2021digital}, we examine how algorithmic classification and risk scoring create strategic dynamics between state surveillance apparatus and targeted populations. The analysis suggests a mechanism through which technological advances in surveillance can be associated with systematically harsher control policies. We introduce an interpretation suggesting that algorithmic errors and false positives may be tolerated or even strategically advantageous under certain political objectives. The paper contributes to debates on algorithmic governance by demonstrating how formal game theory can illuminate the political logic of surveillance systems.
